## Project Structure

- Each topic has its own directory: `01-hello-world/`, `02-values/`, etc.
- Each directory contains a `main.go` with the example code
- Practice exercises go in the same directory as `exercise.go` or similar

## Workflow

1. User picks a topic to study
2. Claude fetches content from gobyexample.com, explains key concepts
3. User writes code, Claude helps run and debug
4. Claude provides practice exercises
5. Git commit progress, update README checklist

## Conventions

- Use `go run` to execute examples
- Keep code comments in English
- Discussion and explanations can be in Chinese (user preference)
